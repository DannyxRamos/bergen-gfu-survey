# Graduation Follow-Up (GFU) Survey Report

This project analyzes and visualizes results from the **Graduation Follow-Up (GFU) Survey** at Bergen Community College. The GFU is conducted annually to learn what students do after graduating — whether they transfer to a 4-year institution, enter the workforce, or pursue other opportunities.

## Purpose

The GFU survey helps the college:
- Track graduate outcomes by major and degree type
- Identify top transfer institutions and employers
- Support grant reporting and program improvement
- Meet federal/state reporting requirements

## Tools Used
- **Python** – Data cleaning and visual generation
- **Pandas** – Handling raw survey exports and fixing inconsistencies
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Creating clean visuals for reporting
- **Excel** – Used to supplement analysis and organize charts
- **PowerPoint / Word** – Final report formatting and layout

## My Contributions
- Cleaned and prepared raw GFU survey data for analysis
- Created a structured reporting framework, organizing visuals logically by question category
- Built charts summarizing:
  - Transfer schools by major
  - Employment sectors by degree
  - Rate of students continuing education vs. working
  - Open-ended post-grad comments
- Delivered visuals and written documentation for use in institutional reporting

## Files Included
- `gfu_survey_cleaning_demo.py` – Python script used to clean and visualize the GFU data
- `mock_gfu_survey_data.xlsx` – Synthetic example of GFU responses
- `/visuals/` – Sample output charts (fictional data)

## Notes
- Real survey results are confidential and not included in this repo.
- All data and visuals are generated using synthetic or de-identified examples to demonstrate workflow.
